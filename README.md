# LookAtMe
This project requires [MMOMinion](https://www.mmominion.com/misc.php?page=ffxivbot), a FFXIV botting client, in order to function & run.
 This add-on is dead simple. Turn it on & watch as the first person who targets you gets TP'd to directly above.
 The add-on will stay on the earliest to-target you person, & hop to the 2nd earliest, once the 1st has stopped.

## Install
    -Clone this repository inside your lua modules (C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods).
    -Rename the folder name to LookAtMe.
    -Reload lua inside the game or attach the client if it hasn't already been done so.

## Things to keep in mind   
    -You are at fault if you use this script & get banned for it, not I.
    -This script uses TELEPORT HACKS. Only use it on accounts you don't mind losing! (Free trials etc)
